# =============================================================================
# [1] Carry out basic mathematic operations using python
# =============================================================================
#%%
# [i]    addition


# [ii]  subtraction


# [iii] multiplication


# [iv]  division


# [v]   exponent


#%%

# =============================================================================
# [2] Assign and update a variable
# =============================================================================

# [i]    Assign a value to a variable


# [ii]   Print that variable 


# [iii]  Update that variable to make it a new value


# [iv]   Print the variable to see if it updated


#%%

# =============================================================================
# [3] Working with strings
# =============================================================================

# [i]   Assign your name, in string format, to an aptly named variable


# [ii]  Check to see that the value in your variable is a string


# [iii] Change all of the characters in the variable to lower case


# [iv]  Use f strings to create a message which includes your name variable


# [v]   Create a string of ten numbers separated by commas


#%%
# =============================================================================
#  [4] Working with lists
# =============================================================================

# [i]   Take the string you created in [3][v] and turn it into a list


# [ii]  Get the value of the third item in the list


# [iii] Get the same value but use negative indexing


# [iv]  Get the first two items in the list using slice notation


# [v]   Get every second item from the list


# [vi]  Update item at index 5 to a new value


# [vii] Update item at index 6 to a new value which is the sum of
#       the value of item index 2 and item index 3 together


# [viii] Add a new value to the end of the list


# [ix]  Delete the value at item index 5


#%%

# =============================================================================
# [5] Working with dictionaries
# =============================================================================

# [i]   Create a dictionary with two keys, have the first key contain
#       a list of integers and the second key contain a list of strings


# [ii]  Print out only the second keys values


# [iii] Get the value of the first item in the first keys values


#%%
# =============================================================================
#  [6] Conditional statements
# =============================================================================

x = 100
y = 200

# [i]   Does x equal y


# [ii]  Does either x or y equal 200


# [iii] Does x and y equal 50


# [iv]  Does half of y equal x?


#[v]    Does half of y equal x and does double x equal y


#%%
# =============================================================================
#  [7]  For loops
# =============================================================================

# [i]   Create a for loop which loops over the list you created in [3][v]
#       and prints each item into a f string.




#%%


# [ii]  Create a for loop which will only print the value of the item
#       in the list if it is greater than or equal to the last item in the list




#%%
# [iii] Create a for loop which will loop over your list and append each item to
#       a new list




#%%
# =============================================================================
#  [8] Create a function
# =============================================================================

# [i] Create a function which asks for the users details and returns a dictionary
#     with the keys 'Name', 'Date of birth', and 'Nationality'.
#     Assign the output to a variable.
