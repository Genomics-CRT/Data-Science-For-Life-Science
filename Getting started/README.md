# Introduction
This document contains a breakdown of the topics covered in the workshop. Materials will be generated and diseminated on a week to week basis. Thus, folders for topics in the outline may not be instantly available.

#### Week 1
###### Installing Dependencies
Working under the assumption that most participants have either a MacOS or a Windows operating system, it is crucial for each user to have access to the same software. For this we have decided to use Anaconda, a package manager deployable across Windows, Mac & Linux systems. The first week of the Workshop will be dedicated to making sure each participant has a fully working version of Anaconda, and providing a tutorial on how to install the software we will be using during the workshop.

###### Creating a Github account
Github is a free website where users can access code repositories, and create their own repositories to store code, notes and small files of data (max 20MB). As the workshop is being conducted via github, we strongly encourage participants to create a github account. This will be covered in a tutorial.
