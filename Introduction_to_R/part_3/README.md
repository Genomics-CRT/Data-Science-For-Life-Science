**Welcome to the data visualisation portion of this Introduction to R course.**

This week will rely heavily on the use of the `ggplot2` R package. Go ahead and install the package now by running `install.packages('ggplot2')` in R Studio. Read the learning materials to find out about :sparkles: **the magic of `ggplot2`** :sparkles: and then attempt the worksheet to make some pretty plots​. All relevant links below:

1. [**Learning Materials**](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/Data-Science-For-Life-Science/blob/master/Introduction_to_R/Part_3/Data_Visualisation_in_R-Learning_Materials.md) 
2. **Worksheet**
   - To download the R markdown version of the worksheet, follow [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Genomics-CRT/Data-Science-For-Life-Science/master/Introduction_to_R/Part_3/Data_Visualisation_in_R-Worksheet.Rmd) &rarr; right click anywhere on the page &rarr; select `Save as...` to save file to your local machine &rarr; open the file in R Studio.
   - To download the HTML version of the worksheet, follow [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Genomics-CRT/Data-Science-For-Life-Science/master/Introduction_to_R/Part_3/Data_Visualisation_in_R-Worksheet.html) &rarr; right click anywhere on the page &rarr; select `Save as...` to save file to your local machine &rarr; open the file in your browser.
3. **Worksheet Solutions**
   - Will be posted here on Thursday 7<sup>th</sup> May. I'll likely post the solutions before the Zoom conference so that you can download them and be running through the code alongside me during the meeting.
